A)​ INTRODUCTION
We may have to collect and use information about people with whom we work. This personal

whether it be on paper, in computer records or recorded by any other means.
We regard the lawful and correct treatment of personal information as very important to our successful

To this end we fully endorse and adhere to the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation

D)​ TYPES OF DATA HELD
We keep several categories of personal data on everyone in order to carry out effective and efficient

E)​ EMPLOYEE RIGHTS
You have the following rights in relation to the personal data we hold on you:
a)​ the right to be informed about the data we hold on you and what we do with it;
b)​ the right of access to the data we hold on you. More information on this can be found in the
section headed “Access to Data” below and in our separate policy on Subject Access Requests”;

f)​ the right to transfer the data we hold on you to another party. This is also known as ‘portability’;

More information can be found on each of these rights in our separate policy on employee rights under

F)​ RESPONSIBILITIES
In order to protect the personal data of relevant individuals, those within our business who must process
data as part of their role have been made aware of our policies on data protection.
We have also appointed employees with responsibility for reviewing and auditing our data protection
systems.
G)​ LAWFUL BASES OF PROCESSING
We acknowledge that processing may be only be carried out where a lawful basis for that processing exists
and we have assigned a lawful basis against each processing activity.
Where no other lawful basis applies, we may seek to rely on the persons consent in order to process data.
However, we recognise the high standard attached to its use. We understand that consent must be freely
given, specific, informed and unambiguous. Where consent is to be sought, we will do so on a specific
and individual basis where appropriate. Everyone will be given clear instructions on the desired
processing activity, informed of the consequences of their consent and of their clear right to withdraw
consent at any time.
H)​ ACCESS TO DATA
As stated above, everyone has a right to access the personal data that we hold on them. To exercise this
right, employees and customers should make a Subject Access Request. We will comply with the request
without delay, and within one month unless, in accordance with legislation, we decide that an extension is
required. Those who make a request will be kept fully informed of any decision to extend the time limit.
No charge will be made for complying with a request unless the request is manifestly unfounded,
excessive or repetitive, or unless a request is made for duplicate copies to be provided to parties other
than the employee making the request. In these circumstances, a reasonable charge will be applied.
Further information on making a subject access request is contained in our Subject Access Request policy.
I)​
DATA DISCLOSURES
The Company may be required to disclose certain data/information to any person. The circumstances
leading to such disclosures include:
a)​ any employee benefits operated by third parties;
b)​ disabled individuals - whether any reasonable adjustments are required to assist them at work or
hirer;
c)​ individuals’ health data - to comply with health and safety or occupational health obligations
towards the employee or hirer;
d)​ for Statutory Sick Pay purposes;
e)​ HR management and administration - to consider how an individual’s health affects his or her
ability to do their job or to hire;
f)​ the smooth operation of any employee and customer’s insurance policies or pension plans;
g)​ the smooth operation of any employee pension plans;
h)​ to assist law enforcement or a relevant authority to prevent or detect crime or prosecute
offenders or to assess or collect any tax or duty.
These kinds of disclosures will only be made when strictly necessary for the purpose.
J)​ DATA SECURITY
All our employees are aware that hard copy personal information should be kept in a locked filing cabinet,
drawer, or safe.
Employees are aware of their roles and responsibilities when their role involves the processing of data.
All employees are instructed to store files or written information of a confidential nature in a secure
manner so that are only accessed by people who have a need and a right to access them and to ensure that
screen locks are implemented on all PCs, laptops etc when unattended. No files or written information of
a confidential nature are to be left where they can be read by unauthorised people.
Where data is computerised, it should be coded, encrypted or password protected both on a local hard
drive and on a network drive that is regularly backed up. If a copy is kept on removable storage media,
that media must itself be kept in a locked filing cabinet, drawer, or safe.
Employees must always use the passwords provided to access the computer system and not abuse them
by passing them on to people who should not have them.
Personal data relating to employees and customers should not be kept or transported on laptops, USB
sticks, or similar devices, unless prior authorisation has been received. Where personal data is recorded on
any such device it should be protected by:
a)​ ensuring that data is recorded on such devices only where absolutely necessary.
b)​ using an encrypted system — a folder should be created to store the files that need extra
protection and all files created or moved to this folder should be automatically encrypted.
c)​ ensuring that laptops or USB drives are not left where they can be stolen.
Failure to follow the Company’s rules on data security may be dealt with via the Company’s disciplinary
procedure. Appropriate sanctions include dismissal with or without notice dependent on the severity of
the failure.
K)​ THIRD PARTY PROCESSING
Where we engage third parties to process data on our behalf, we will ensure, via a data processing
agreement with the third party, that the third party takes such measures in order to maintain the
Company’s commitment to protecting data.
L)​ INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
The Company does not transfer personal data to any recipients outside of the EEA.
M)​ REQUIREMENT TO NOTIFY BREACHES
All data breaches will be recorded on our Data Breach Register. Where legally required, we will report a
breach to the Information Commissioner within 72 hours of discovery. In addition, where legally
required, we will inform the individual whose data was subject to breach.
More information on breach notification is available in our Breach Notification policy.
N)​ TRAINING
New employees must read and understand the policies on data protection as part of their induction.
All employees receive training covering basic information about confidentiality, data protection and the
actions to take upon identifying a potential data breach.
The nominated data controller/auditors/protection officers for the Company are trained appropriately in
their roles under the GDPR.
All employees who need to use the computer system are trained to protect individuals’ private data, to
ensure data security, and to understand the consequences to them as individuals and the Company of any
potential lapses and breaches of the Company’s policies and procedures.
O)​ RECORDS
The Company keeps records of its processing activities including the purpose for the processing and
retention periods in its Data Record. These records will be kept up to date so that they reflect current
processing activities.
